Develop a program that contains multiple classes.

Choose one of the topics.

Easy: Cheese shop

Should contain these classes.

Cheese 

CheeseShop - gives access for the shop owner to add/remove different cheeses, gives access for the customer to buy different cheeses, remove cheese from cart, should be possible to get all the cheeses from the cart or available cheeses in the store

Main - User UI, accesses CheeseService and CheeseShop to buy or to add different cheeses.

Should be possible to use 12.06.2024 lesson as an example and/or check out at discord the teamwork from other students.



Medium: same as easy, but add 2 more classes

CheeseService - gives access for the shop owner to add different cheeses (should remove this functionality from CheeseShop)

Customer - contains money the customer has, contains the items the customer owns. Whenever the customer buys something, money is reduced. If customer doesn't have any money left, then notify the user about it.



Hard: Same as medium, but save all the data in JSON.txt file. Should be able to save all the data in JSON and when opening the program again, it should save all the information.

Python
Easy Level
In this level, you will read the data from prices.txt (see additional files),  compute the total price of all items, and count the total number of purchased items. 

! If you don't know how to deal with non integer characters, remove them manually from the file !

Medium Level
In this level, we will extend the program to skip rows that contain anything other than a number in the code. (Modify your program in such a way that all rows that contain something else than a number, are skipped.)
